A comprehensive, type-safe, auto-generated TypeScript client for NEAR Protocol's JSON-RPC interface. Built with modern tooling, runtime validation, and optimized for developer experience.

## 📦 Packages

This monorepo contains two npm packages:

### [@near-js/jsonrpc-types](./packages/jsonrpc-types)
[![NPM Version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@near-js/jsonrpc-types)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@near-js/jsonrpc-types)

TypeScript types and Zod validation schemas for NEAR Protocol's JSON-RPC interface.

- **Lightweight**: Only TypeScript types and Zod schemas
- **Tree-shakable**: Import only what you need  
- **Runtime validation**: Zod-powered type safety
- **Auto-generated**: Always up-to-date with NEAR's API

```bash
npm install @near-js/jsonrpc-types
```

### [@near-js/jsonrpc-client](./packages/jsonrpc-client)
[![NPM Version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@near-js/jsonrpc-client)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@near-js/jsonrpc-client)

Complete RPC client implementation with full type safety and error handling.

- **Type-safe**: Full TypeScript coverage with runtime validation
- **Auto-retry**: Built-in retry logic with exponential backoff  
- **Error handling**: Comprehensive error types and handling
- **Zero config**: Works out of the box with sensible defaults

```bash
npm install @near-js/jsonrpc-client
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

```typescript
import { NearJsonRpcClient } from '@near-js/jsonrpc-client';

// Initialize client
const client = new NearJsonRpcClient('https://rpc.mainnet.near.org');

// Get latest block
const block = await client.blocks.getLatestBlock();
console.log(`Latest block height: ${block.header.height}`);

// Get account info
const account = await client.accounts.getAccount({ accountId: 'near' });
console.log(`Account balance: ${account.amount}`);
```

## 🏗️ Architecture

```
near-js-client/
├── packages/
│   ├── jsonrpc-types/     # TypeScript types & Zod schemas
│   └── jsonrpc-client/    # Complete RPC client
├── tools/
│   └── codegen/           # OpenAPI code generation tools
├── tests/                 # Comprehensive test suite
└── .github/workflows/     # Automated CI/CD pipelines
```

### Code Generation Pipeline

1. **Fetch OpenAPI Spec**: Weekly automated fetching from NEAR Protocol repository
2. **Parse & Transform**: Extract method definitions, convert snake_case to camelCase
3. **Generate Types**: Create TypeScript interfaces and Zod validation schemas
4. **Generate Client**: Build type-safe client methods with proper error handling
5. **Path Correction**: Ensure all requests use "/" endpoint (NEAR Protocol requirement)

## 🧪 Testing

Comprehensive testing with multiple layers:

- **Unit Tests**: Type validation, method implementations, error handling
- **Integration Tests**: Real RPC endpoint testing (optional)
- **Mock Tests**: Simulated responses for reliable CI/CD
- **Coverage**: 80%+ test coverage requirement

```bash
npm test              # Run all tests
npm run test:unit     # Run unit tests only  
npm run test:coverage # Generate coverage report
```

## 🔧 Development

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ 
- npm 8+

### Setup
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/near/near-js-client.git
cd near-js-client

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build packages
npm run build

# Run tests
npm test

# Type check
npm run typecheck
```

### Code Generation
```bash
# Regenerate code from OpenAPI spec
npm run generate

# This will:
# 1. Fetch latest OpenAPI spec from NEAR Protocol
# 2. Generate TypeScript types and Zod schemas  
# 3. Generate client methods with proper typing
# 4. Update both packages
```

## 📊 Automation
